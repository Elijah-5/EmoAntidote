# EmoEntidote - Emotion-Based Music & Meditation Experience
A class project for infosci104 digital design (25Spr S3).
## Overview
EmoEntidote is an iOS app designed to help you explore your emotions through guided meditation and AI-generated music. By selecting your emotional state, you can choose between two immersive modes: music generation or a dynamic meditation maze. 

- **Music Mode**: Generate music based on your emotional state to help you connect with your feelings.
- **Maze Mode**: Embark on a meditation journey through a virtual maze where each step is guided by audio instructions. Reflect on your emotions and make choices that shape your path.

## Features
- **Two Modes**:
  - **Music Mode**: Generate a unique song based on your selected emotion.
  - **Maze Mode**: Navigate through a meditation maze. Receive audio instructions based on your emotion, reflecting the path and environment you are in.
  
- **Interactive Experience**: In maze mode, after each meditation instruction, you will reflect on your emotional state and choose between left or right paths, each leading to new meditation instructions and a deeper emotional journey.
